FAQ
What does this mean?
This post has been done before and/or is repetetive
Why did you do this?
There are several reasons I may deem a post to be worthy of snail. These include, but are not limited to:
Dead meme,
Blatant reposting,
Old news.
Am I banned from the server?
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making reposts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional snail, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
I don't believe my post deserved a snail. Can you un-snail it?
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a snail. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to DMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of snail appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
Accept the snail and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Discord. I will continue to issue snails until you improve your conduct. Remember: Discord is privilege, not a right.
